"""Lasso by coordinate descent over a Gram matrix, from Scheme via C++.

The solver is `examples/kernel-only/lasso-cov.scm` in the scm2cpp
repository, translated to C++ and compiled at install time.  It takes
the covariance route: given X'X and X'y, each coordinate step costs
O(p) instead of O(n), so a whole regularization path is cheap once the
Gram matrix exists.  The descent is exactly resumable, which is what
lets a path be walked warm and a batch of lambdas be handed to a GPU.

    from scm2cpp_lasso import CovLasso

    model = CovLasso(X, y)                     # forms the Gram matrix
    path = model.fit_path(lambdas)             # warm, sequential
    grid = model.fit_path_batch(lambdas)       # cold, one thread each

`fit_path_batch` uses CUDA when the package was built with nvcc present
and a device is visible, and falls back to the CPU otherwise; ask
`cuda_available()` if you need to know which you got.

Designs with structure need not form X'X the general way.  `kernel`
exposes the translated functions directly, and `scm2cpp-tfs` uses them
to build the Gram matrix of a moving-average design in O(n p) time and
no design matrix at all.
